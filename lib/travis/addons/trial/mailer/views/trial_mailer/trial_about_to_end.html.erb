        <h3>Your Travis CI Trial</h3>

        <p>
          The trial for your Travis CI account <strong>"<%= @owner[:name].blank? ? @owner[:login] : "#{@owner[:name]} (GitHub name: #{@owner[:login]})" %>"</strong> is close to running out.
        </p>

        <p>
          But not to worry, you have <strong><%= @builds_remaining %> builds left</strong>!
        </p>

        <p>
          To ensure uninterrupted service, <a href="https://billing.travis-ci.com/subscriptions/<%= @owner[:billing_slug] %>">sign the account up for a subscription</a> before the trial runs out. Note that you need to be an owner of the account to sign up for a subscription.
        </p>
